    <div class="message-box">
      <p class="fade-line">Khyati didi… 🥹💫 I know it hasn’t been very long since we met, but somehow… you have already become such a soft, beautiful part of my life. 🌸💗🎀</p>

      <p class="fade-line">Last year on your birthday, I couldn’t even meet you… our bond wasn’t that strong, and honestly, I never knew that one day you would mean so much to me. But today, when I look at us… I feel lucky. Lucky that I got to know <strong>you</strong> — someone so adorable, so pretty, so full of attitude yet full of love. 💫</p>

      <p class="fade-line">You listen. You show affection. You take stands for me, even if it means going against your brother 😭🫶 — that kind of loyalty is rare and I treasure it deeply.</p>

      <p class="fade-line">There’s no single favourite memory — every time we meet becomes its own little world of comfort and joy. Because your presence itself feels like a warm hug. 💌</p>

      <p class="fade-line">You are strong, Khyati. But even strong souls deserve protection and softness — I always want to protect your heart, your emotions, and your beautiful vulnerability. 🧿💗✨</p>

      <p class="fade-line highlight">🎀 HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KHYATI DIDI. I LOVE YOU A LOT. Thank you for being a part of my life. I pray this chapter never ends — I want you in my life forever. 🫀🌸✨</p>

      <p class="fade-line end-line">You’re my cutie, my material-girl princess, and the sister I never knew I needed. 💋🥰💌</p>
