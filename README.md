# 🎀 Khyati Birthday Website — Mixed Cute + Luxury

This is a pastel, luxury-themed birthday website made for **Khyati Didi** by **Samridhi**.

## Pages included
- `index.html` — Home / Intro
- `message.html` — Long emotional message
- `reasons.html` — Why I love you
- `surprise.html` — Surprise reveal (confetti)
- `memories.html` — Our memories / timeline
- `openwhen.html` — Open-When letters
- `signature.html` — Final signature note
- `style.css` — Styling & animations
- `main.js` — Effects, loader, cursor trail, confetti
- `music.mp3` — Background music (add your Dusk Till Dawn mp3)

## How to deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a public repository (e.g., `khyati-birthday-site`).
2. Upload all files in this folder (including `music.mp3`).
3. In GitHub repo → **Settings → Pages** set source to `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
4. Save and wait ~1–2 minutes. Your site will be live at:
   `https://your-username.github.io/khyati-birthday-site/`

## Notes & customisation
- Music: place `music.mp3` in the root folder. Autoplay may be blocked until the user taps — we start on first tap for best browser compatibility.
- To edit text: open each `.html` and change text inside `<p>` or headings.
- To add images: create an `assets/` folder and reference them with `<img src="assets/your.jpg">`.
- Want extra effects (butterfly cursor, page-specific animations, or a gallery)? Ask and I'll add.

Made with 💗 — go make her day magical ✨
